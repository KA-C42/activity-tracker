# Activity Tracker

A mobile productivity app built with Expo and TypeScript that helps users understand how they spend their time through activity tracking, Pomodoro sessions, and visual analytics.

## Description

The Activity Tracker App is an in-progress mobile-first project built with a focus on clarity and mindfulness. It helps users track how they spend their time by manually logging activities, visualizing patterns, and identifying trends in productivity and rest. Future releases will introduce Pomodoro timers, mood tracking, and customizable analytics dashboards. The projectâ€™s long-term goal is to encourage intentional, balanced living through thoughtful design and accessible data.
